# Intelligent Road Safety Detection and Alerts 🚗🚧

## Overview 📝
Intelligent Road Safety Detection and Alerts is an advanced system designed to address road safety concerns, particularly the issue of road damage that affects both general traffic flow and emergency services. Utilizing cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, this system aims to detect road damage automatically and alert the relevant authorities in real-time. Leveraging the power of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection, this solution ensures efficient identification of road hazards, allowing for quick responses to mitigate disruptions in road safety and emergency services.

## Key Features ⚙️

### 1. **Automatic Road Damage Detection 🛣️**:
- Utilizes ML and DL models to detect road damage from CCTV/traffic cameras and user-submitted images/videos.
- YOLO-based object detection provides real-time identification of potholes, cracks and other hazards.

### 2. **User-Reported Data Integration 📸**:
- The system allows users to submit reports, including images, videos, GPS locations and descriptions of road damage.
- Ensures that crowd-sourced data is efficiently processed for quicker detection and reporting.

### 3. **Real-Time Alerts for Authorities 🚨**:
- Once road damage is detected, the system forwards alerts to the relevant public welfare or city administrative officers for immediate action.
- If no action is taken within 48 hours, the report is escalated to a higher authority to ensure accountability.

### 4. **Emergency Response Integration 🚑** _(future implementation)_:
- Ambulance drivers are alerted in real-time about road damage to optimize emergency response times and avoid delays due to hazardous conditions.

### 5. **Seamless Administrative Management 🏛️**:
- Centralized system for managing road damage reports, escalating unresolved issues and ensuring timely action.

## Motivation 💡
Road damage poses a significant threat to public safety and emergency services, especially in congested urban areas. This system aims to reduce the impact of such hazards by offering an intelligent, automated and scalable solution that can detect road damage and alert the necessary authorities in a timely manner. By integrating user reports, machine learning and administrative management, this project aims to enhance road safety and optimize the maintenance of critical infrastructure.

## Technologies Used 🖥️

- **YOLOv5** (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection
- **Machine Learning (ML)** for classification and identification of road damage
- **Deep Learning (DL)** for neural networks and image processing
- **Python** for backend, ML models and data processing
- **OpenCV** for image and video manipulation
- **Flask** for web frameworks and API development
- **GPS Integration** for real-time location tracking and geo-tagging
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JS for frontend
- **DataBase**: PostgreSQL

## How It Works 🔄

### 1. **Data Collection 📥**:
- The system collects images, videos, GPS locations and damage descriptions from various sources, including user submissions and CCTV/traffic cameras.

### 2. **Damage Detection 🔍**:
- YOLO-based object detection models process the input data to identify road damage like potholes, cracks and surface degradation.

### 3. **Automatic Reporting 📬**:
- Detected issues are automatically forwarded to the relevant authorities (public welfare officers or city administrators) for resolution.
- If the issue is not addressed within 48 hours, it is escalated to a higher authority.

### 4. **Emergency Alerts 🚨** _(future implementation)_:
- Ambulance drivers receive real-time notifications of detected road damage to plan their routes accordingly.

### 5. **Administration Dashboard 📊**:
- A centralized dashboard helps city authorities track the status of reported damages, pending actions and escalating unresolved cases.

## Setup and Installation ⚙️

### Prerequisites 📋
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Django, Numpy, etc.
- YOLOv5 pre-trained model weights

### Installation Steps 🔧

1. **Clone the repository**:
